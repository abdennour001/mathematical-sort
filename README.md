# mathematical-sort
Well, Hello World! In this project i'm trying to develop a mathematical formula to hash a single string into an unique integer using a specific function "Î·" that takes two principal arguments, first is the string itself, the second is the flag of which sort function we will been using (lexicographic sort, lexicographic sort reverse, sort by number of distinct characters, sort by length). This function will generate some specific hash integer, and to sort an array of strings, we just need to generate that hash for all strings and then sort the array of the hashes integers.
